# Trading Algorithm README

## Overview

This project implements a trading algorithm using the Alpaca API for algorithmic trading. The algorithm is designed to automate trading decisions based on predefined strategies and market conditions. It's important to note that this is a paper trading bot, meaning it simulates trading in a risk-free environment, utilizing Alpaca's paper trading API.

## Features

- **Algorithmic Trading:** The bot employs various trading strategies, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands, to make informed buy and sell decisions.

- **API Integration:** The Alpaca API is integrated into the application to access real-time market data, execute trades, and manage account information.

- **Paper Trading:** The bot operates in a paper trading environment, allowing users to simulate trading without risking real capital.

- **Risk Management:** Risk management features are implemented to ensure prudent capital allocation, position sizing, and risk mitigation.

- **Backtesting:** The bot offers a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of trading strategies against historical data for strategy refinement and optimization.

- **User Interface:** A user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) is provided for configuring and monitoring the trading bot, offering easy access to strategy settings and account information.
